#### The first game is inspired by Agario and Asteroids. It is a free for all multiplayer game using SocketIO. 
Players can eat the green food to gain mass and ammo. Players can shoot opponents or eat them if they are bigger than them. 
Getting hit reduces your size and you will die if you get too small. 
Player names and images are downloaded from Vapour's database.

####The second game is a classic game of Pong. It is a 1v1 game using SocketIO but more players can spectate and join a queue. 
The loser will be sent to the back of the queue and the winner keeps playing. 
Player names and images are downloaded from Vapour's database.

#### The platform also has 2 single player games: Snake and a side scroller.
